# Combinatorial Optimization - Mixed-Integer Linnear Programming

This repo contains some of the projects in Combinatorial Optimization that I worked during my Master's studies.

Tools used:
- **CPLEX**: Python API for IBM CPLEX Optimizer. CPLEX Optimizer provides flexible, high-performance mathematical programming solvers for linear programming, mixed integer programming, quadratic programming and quadratically constrained programming problems. These solvers include a distributed parallel algorithm for mixed integer programming to leverage multiple computers to solve difficult problems.

- **SCIP**: One of the fastest non-commercial solvers for mixed integer programming (MIP) and mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). It is also a framework for constraint integer programming and branch-cut-and-price. 
  It allows for total control of the solution process and the access of detailed information down to the guts of the solver.
